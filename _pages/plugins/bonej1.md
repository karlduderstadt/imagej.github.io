BoneJ is a plugin for bone image analysis in [ImageJ](/about). It provides free, open source tools for trabecular geometry and whole bone shape analysis.

## Current release ([BoneJ2](/plugins/bonej))

There's a new modernized version of BoneJ available through the ImageJ [updater](/plugins/updater). Read more about [BoneJ2](/plugins/bonej).

## Legacy (BoneJ v1.x) Installation

{% include logo content='ImageJ1' size='24px' %} BoneJ was originally designed to work with plain [ImageJ 1.x](/software/imagej1).

{% include logo content='Fiji' size='24px' %} BoneJ can be installed into [Fiji](/fiji), but you must **use the Java-6 version of Fiji, not the current Java-8 version**:

-   Download the final Java-6 version of Fiji labeled "2017 May 30" from [here](/fiji/downloads#java-6).
-   Unpack it somewhere beneath your home folder.
-   Download and install `BoneJ_.jar` into that installation's `plugins` folder.
-   Launch Fiji and run {% include bc path='Plugins | 3D Viewer'%} to trigger installation of the [3D Viewer](/plugins/3d-viewer).
-   Restart Fiji.

For technical details about ImageJ and Fiji using Java 6 vs. Java 8, see the [Java 8](/news/2016-05-10_-_ImageJ_HOWTO_-_Java_8,_Java_6,_Java_3D) page.

## BoneJ and pQCT

BoneJ and pQCT plug-ins are in the process of separation. The latter have their own [update site](/plugins/pqct), and they don't need BoneJ to work. However, if you download `BoneJ_.jar` from [bonej.org](http://bonej.org/legacy) it still includes older versions of the pQCT tools.
