I uploaded two HowTos to YouTube that illustrate the basic usage of the plugin, which makes use of the algorithms implemented in [BigStitcher](/plugins/bigstitcher).

Dan White: Need to write docs here for how to use this plugin for measuring chromatic shift in multi channel z stacks, or 2D images of a field of beads, and apply the transform to the biological images.
